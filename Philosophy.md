### Guiding principles
- Good examples are important when learning abstract concepts.
	- Although communicating concepts abstractly has significant benefits, examples take advantage of people's considerable ability to learn through inductive inference.  In addition to an abstract explanation, good examples are crucial {word}.
	- Learning is not only about internalizing a pattern, but also about being able to recognize the pattern in experience.  Examples help one make the connection between a concept and its instances.
- "Value-agnostic."  The goal of this framework is not to advocate, but to logically map premises to conclusions, requiring the user to apply this map to their own values.
- Knowledge isn't linear or hierarchical and is best stored in formats capable of representing more complex structure.

### Rationale {motivation}
- The organization and integration of existing knowledge is a constructive pursuit that will become increasingly important as the state of the art becomes increasingly specialized.
- Our intuitions already "compute" many of these patterns precisely and efficiently, often more so than we're able to consciously.  However, when individuals disagree, intuition provides little recourse because the rationale for an intuitive belief is often unknown or difficult to communicate.  Making these patterns explicit provides a language with which to reconcile conflicting intuitions, and may allow us to more easily recognize instances in which intuition fails to provide rational guidance.  Additionally, intuition doesn't scale well with complexity or adapt readily to novel situations.

### Caveats
- "No easy answers."  These are simple, general rules, but they can only be applied by taking into account the full complexity of a situation, which may include multiple levels and instances of interacting patterns, as well as complex inputs.
