Minimizing the negative effects of undesirable, but unpreventable, behavior.

Giving unpreventable behavior a safe outlet, even though it might increase its prevalence.\
The balance between providing an outlet but reinforcing undesirable behavior, and discouraging undesirable behavior but pushing its practice to the unregulated margins.\
When defects are bound to form, it can be beneficial to introduce them in a controlled way so as to minimize their impact.

Controlled defects\
Relaxing restrictions when they are unenforceable.\
Maintaining control of a system even when there are costs to doing so.

Criminalizing or otherwise absolutely disallowing undesirable but largely unpreventable behavior may not only push that behavior to the unregulated margins, but can also breed disrespect for the rule of law.  Analogy of trying to compress some gas beyond your ability to contain it: some of the gas escapes out the sides, fully decompressing.  The goal is to create the smallest volume of gas possible, which means maintaining control of it instead of trying to force an unrealizable ideal. Of course some gas will always escape, so a balance is needed between minimizing escape by using less compression and minimizing volume by using more compression.  Also need to factor in the possibility that the gas shouldn't actually be compressed ([justified means](Justified%20means.md)).

Only draw a line in the sand if it's defensible.\
Bend, don't break.\
Breakpoints

Harm reduction vs abstinence, etc

Cover-ups. The Streisand effect. Back-fire.
- a successful cover-up will hide something, but an unsuccessful one will make it more visible than it otherwise would have been
- by confessing, you maintain some control over the response (e.g. by initiating and framing the conversation)

The balloon effect: controlling a problem in one area can just push the problem to a new area ([homeostasis](Homeostasis.md)?)

Relationship to [criticality](Criticality.md)
- the "line in the sand" as the critical point?
- so this pattern would be about what happens when you change the critical point?

The flip side: being too lax on undesirable behavior ([slippery slope](Slippery%20slope.md))

In materials science: controlled dislocations
- "the weakest link": controlled dislocations is akin to distributing the weakness throughout the chain
- relation to "bottleneck"?

Examples:
- drug laws (incl. prohibition in the US)
- clean needles for junkies
- violent video games
- prostitution laws
- porn
- fetishes
- trying to prevent adolescents from having sex, and not making condoms easy to obtain
- teaching responsibility vs abstinence
- hpv vaccine: from a parent's perspective, it can admit that their kid needs to be protected from something that the parent prohibits; it's an admission of weakness of their authority
- vaccines in general: introducing a pathogen in a controlled manner has its own risks, but may prevent the relatively severe effects of an infection
- iOS being locked down can push people to jailbreak or sideload apps
- drm can make piracy more attractive (while at the same time making piracy more difficult) or just push people away from the content entirely
	- inability to watch/play/listen without an internet connection
	- bugs with HDCP implementation, preventing computer from displaying movies on the tv
	- (see note in [utility](Utility.md))
- making a kid afraid of calling parents for help, or incentivizing them to drive home drunk instead of getting caught partying
- completely abstaining from something like soylent, which for some people would mean relying on hotdogs and pizza
- abortion
- immigration: making it easier/harder to legally immigrate
- skate parks: kids skating vs causing trouble
- bug bounty programs: giving hackers a legitimate way to make money
- building something to age gracefully vs look new indefinitely
- requiring hard to remember passwords, so users write them down
- outright banning of GMOs vs regulation
- deadlines: setting them can make you work faster toward your goal, but can compromise the output if too tight and/or strict
- free speech, censorship, and moderation: if you ban certain types of content from a site, it'll push it to a less controlled site
	- Note that this (like most other examples) is not zero-sum.  Even though the banned content could move to a less controlled site, that will involve costs which are likely to decrease its prevalence. ([homeostasis](Homeostasis.md))
	- dark web, reddit
- controlled forest fire, avalanche blasting
- stretching muscles
- Google adding selective ad-blocking to Chrome
- pandemic lockdowns
	- can't completely keep people from doing what they will, so need to take that into account with messaging and when setting policy
	- China's zero Covid policy
