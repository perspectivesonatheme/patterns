The transition of a system between two different classes of behavior.

{TODO: Difference between the transition between two classes of behavior (traffic), and the addition of two opposed functions (coal worker, failure rate)?}
- Or are they really the same thing?  Think about the traffic or hash tables examplesâ€”it won't be perfectly linear up to the critical point.  The second car on a road has a small chance of slightly impeding the first, and there's a small chance of hash collision even with only two elements.  This would mean there aren't any discontinuities.  They're all just function addition/multiplication where the dominant behavior transitions from one to another.

There can be hidden or opportunity costs to approaching 100% utilization (see personal free time example).

"The last straw".  Percolation models.  Tipping points.  Phase transition.

Examples:
- sizing hash tables
- employee productivity vs {vacation time, work hours / week, etc}
- personal free time - you could think: I'm only actively doing something for 50% of my free time; that means I'm wasting 50%.  But you have to price in the benefits of down time: stress relief, giving your mind time off to digest what it's learned and come up with new ideas.
- traffic: decline in traffic flux past a critical density
- language: the use of "big words" is beneficial up to the point of a reader's ability to interpret their meaning, beyond which understanding drops off sharply
	- same with foreign language comprehension: if you miss the meaning on any one significant word, it can disrupt your ability to understand the whole (percolation model)
- how much coal a worker can carry vs the size of the shovel
	- two opposed functions: coal carrying capacity and worker exertion
- failure rate: a plot of any creation's failure rate vs age will be u-shaped, with more failures early on from manufacturing or design flaws, and more failures later on from wear or increasing mismatch between design and environment. E.g. manufactured products, human beings, governments
- the sweet spot of a car's speed when attempting to maximize fuel economy: economy of scale due to fixed cost of running gas engine/accessories vs increasing resistance from drag and friction


### Activation energy
An external impulse supplied to start a self-sustaining reaction.

Critical mass, tipping point, threshold, upfront costs, action potential (which is what happens when an activation energy is reached), jump-start, "getting over the hump"

Catalyst: an external agent that lowers the activation energy\
Stimulus: a provision of the activation energy

"Galvanize"

Upfront costs: big upfront cost vs small recurring costs\
Learning curves: long, but tool is very powerful vs short, but tool is limited in power
- e.g. latex vs word processor, vim/emacs vs nano

Examples:
- economy stimulus spending is a means of pushing past an activation energy
- lighting a fire
- starting a car engine
- wetting current


### Critical mass
When a certain level must be reached before a system becomes viable.

The critical point at which a small change could push the system towards either of two outcomes.

Demand-side economy of scale.

Examples:
- number of people in a social network: network goes to ubiquity (Facebook) or obscurity (Myspace)
- applications: the amount of functionality at which a small change would result in either the app being installed or left uninstalled
	- Some apps are good for what they are, but aren't useful enough to justify installing them (e.g. maybe polling apps {better example?}). Also, I wouldn't carry around a physical notepad, but I do carry around a smartphone with a notepad app ([integration](Integration.md)).
	- there are the fixed costs to finding/installing the app itself, and also the integration costs of apps/features with each other
	- same thing with content in books, blog posts, tweets
- plurality voting system: the percentage of votes needed to become elected
- winner-take-all
- diffusion of information and diseases in a network
	- there is a threshold quantity that determines whether an epidemic occurs or the disease dies out
	- going viral


### Escape velocity
When a certain quantity of a consumable is required in order for the system to reach sustainability before the consumable's supply is exhausted.

Examples:
- saving up enough money with a day job to give you enough time off to work on your own stuff and make it a sustainable source of income
- example of slingshot: can't keep pushing on it after it's released
	- kinetic vs potential energy
- tinder: using enough tinder to get the wood lit before the tinder burns out
