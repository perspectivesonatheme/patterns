The selection of an appropriate model {interpretation} such that it accurately represents the subject while minimizing the model's complexity.

The first step in efficiently solving a problem {answering a question} is framing the problem in a way most likely to result in an effective solution.  If all available options are bad, it's possible that the problem is poorly framed. Sometimes a dilemma is not resolved by picking one of the options, but by "backing out" of the dilemma by reevaluating the assumptions that created it.

"If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions." (Einstein, reportedly)

Physical analogy: a bunch of objects connected by strings and all jumbled up; attempt to untangle and pick up objects so that, when hanging, they fall in a nice, neat structure {need concrete example}.

Planar lattices can be transformed to cubes.
Imagine a lattice like this one:
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ea/Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg/858px-Hasse_diagram_of_powerset_of_3.svg.png

It can be seen to be corners of a cube.
If we can find a diagram with further subdivisions, we can get a tangled object which if you take up the right vertex and pull it upwords and it the legs of it gets clicked together to form a huge well subdivided cube.

- or the graph visualization libraries that try to lay out all the nodes and edges such that there's minimal node overlap and edge crossings

Looking at some physical object from different perspectives. From one angle, the object looks complex and random, so describing it would require a large amount of information. From another angle, the object looks very orderly and has a simple description.

Edge cases can be an indicator of an inappropriate model.  They mean that the model doesn't fit the subject at certain points, and could be a sign that the model has other inaccuracies that haven't yet been discovered.

Support vector machines: "an SVM model is a representation of the examples as points in space, mapped so that the examples of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible." (Wikipedia)
- or classification algorithms in general

Examples:
- Arabic vs Roman numerals
- Cartesian vs polar coordinates
- pi is a complicated number but a simple geometrical concept
	- two different representations of the same thing (3.14159... vs C/2r); the number is a reframing of the geometrical representation
- the theory of evolution as a lens for human behavior
	- how we choose mates
- (from "Model Thinking", Week 5, lecture 2): sum to 15 card game and tic tac toe as different framings of the same game
- assuming the earth to be the center of the solar system required the other planets to have complex orbits
	- or circular vs elliptical orbits
- those "3d" street paintings that only look correct from a certain angle
	- (from the wrong angle) "it's a cube distorted in such and such a way"
	- (from the intended angle) "it's a cube"
- people grouped by country borders vs people grouped by ideology, culture, ethnicity, religion, etc (or not grouped at all)
	- countries don't always coincide with peoples
- color spaces: RGB, HSL, Lab, etc

Reframing to resolve a dilemma:
- the debate about getters and setters vs public fields in OOP: the former introduces boilerplate, the latter allows for ad hoc modification of data; by using functional programming/immutable data this debate disappears
	- same with exceptions vs return codes: monads provide a way of conveniently dealing with return codes
- tabs vs spaces: see elastic tabstops
- "thinking outside the box": reframing requires zooming out far enough to get perspective on the current frame ([meta](Levels.md))
- liberal vs conservative

Viewing things using inapt standards:
- taking a trip to the countryside and complaining about how terrible its cities are, not taking into account access to nature and quietness
- taking a trip to the city and complaining about how terrible traffic is, not taking into account public transportation or walkability

- contrast ratio as an OLED spec
- judging a smartphone by how well it makes calls and sends texts
