The construction of a set of orthogonal (composable/non-redundant/modular/etc) abstractions (a *basis*) that spans a space.

The level of abstraction of a basis can be varied to optimize its orthogonality and span.
- it may be impossible to construct an ideal basis that is less complex than the system itself

Fundamental physics describes the universe but is too low-level to practically explain high-level phenomena.  Higher-level laws are practical but lack the orthogonality and span of the physical laws.  These higher-level laws are studied by other sciences, such as chemistry, biology, and classical mechanics.

Fault lines: boundaries of simplest interface

Factorization within a system vs factorization between systems.  For example, when doing text compression, analyzing just the document of interest vs analyzing general usage of e.g. the English language.
- "within a system" is typically easier because the scope of the content is smaller
- "between systems" has the benefit of using a single basis between systems, which can reduce duplication between individual systems' bases

Examples:
- language design (programming or other)
- this patterns framework
- color spaces: RGB, HSL, Lab, etc
- flavor notes?
- a power series as an infinite basis where each subsequent term "fine-tunes" the previous ones
- the set of primes as factors of the natural numbers

[framing](Framing.md): factorization is the construction of a basis; framing is the selection of a basis {?}
