Representing implicit information with an explicit object such that it can be examined and manipulated.

Adding a term to the model\
Bringing pieces of context "into view"\
Subjectâ€“object shift

"Get a handle on"

Examples:
- planning for change instead of assuming something will be perfect
- mindfulness: reifying the thoughts going through your head
- abstractions reify patterns
- this project reifies abstractions
- reification of collective economy: instead of relying on implicit social norms to incentivize social responsibility
- adding transaction costs to a basic free market model {?}
- many examples from software:
	- first class functions
	- monads and effects
	- finite state machines
	- [CLIs as reified interaction](http://www.expressionsofchange.org/reification-of-interaction/)
	- FRP
	- command pattern
	- reflection, metaprogramming, and macros reify code
	- pointers reify access to memory
	- write-ahead logging, journaling
- reifying difficulty of comprehension in system design
	- e.g. Golang as a reaction to cognitively challenging languages like Haskell; its design calculus "adds a term" for difficulty of comprehension
- language reifies thought
- written language, as compared to spoken
- taking notes
- 4D spacetime reifies time
