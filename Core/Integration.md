{TODO: normalize with [abstraction](Abstraction.md) and [outsourcing](Outsourcing.md)}
- see [abstraction-integration](Abstraction-integration.md) for the tradeoffs between abstraction/outsourcing and integration

When a high degree of consensus is reached around a particular system configuration, inter-component costs can outweigh the benefit of modular parts, leading to a monolithic system.  Inversely, a change in requirements (with a corresponding decrease in consensus) can cause the system to move back towards modular parts.  Same thing with an increase/decrease in inter-component costs causing a move towards/away from a monolithic system.  For example, decreasing shipping costs may mean that sourcing or assembling products locally is no longer cheaper than outsourcing to another country.

For example, discrete audio components all take up physical space and require being hooked together with cables.  However, when they are integrated into a receiver, these costs are less than the sum of the individual costs—i.e. a receiver takes up less physical space (physical volume, cabinet space, etc) and requires less cabling than the sum of all the discrete components it replaces.  Integrating the parts allows for both an economy of scale (e.g. physical space) and a reduction of inter-component costs (e.g. cabling).  On the other hand, by tightly coupling the components, they can no longer be shared between systems or mix-and-matched with alternative components.  Additionally, because the receiver's components end up sharing parts like the case and power supply, these parts need to be general enough to meet the requirements of all the components instead of being optimized for any one in particular.
- (Alternative example) Game consoles' CPUs and GPUs can share memory because they're an integrated unit (e.g. the PS4 and Xbox One).  In contrast, gaming PCs with discrete GPUs bring their own memory because they're interchangeable and can't rely on the system meeting their memory requirements.

It's easier to verify the correctness of a system than to create the system yourself ([trapdoor](Search.md#trapdoor)).  For example, buying an integrated receiver vs building your own and ensuring that all the parts work well together.  A schematic abstracts out the design; a receiver abstracts out the design and construction.

Integrated systems may be inefficient if their parts are general and can be used in many different types of systems.  Integration requires these parts to be duplicated across systems.

Integrated vs modular is a relative distinction.  A software library is modular when compared to a program, but integrated when compared to the library's individual functions.

A system may be integrated along one dimension but modular along another.  For example, a vertically integrated company is integrated with respect to suppliers, but modularized with respect to company overheads (e.g. HR, IT, facilities).  Instead of one set per supplier and producer, there is a total of one set for the integrated company.

Locality

Logistics: the task of coordinating the elements of a complex system

"Batteries included"\
"Everything but the kitchen sink" (implies over-consolidation)\
As opposed to "bolted on"

Disjoint: the state of being abstracted when integration would be more efficient
- lack of integration after a consensus has been reached
- [fragmentation](Diversity.md#fragmentation)

	- cars, home appliances, computers, electronics
- game consoles vs gaming PCs
- AOL vs world wide web

- books vs blog posts vs tweets
	- books' higher fixed costs (publisher requirements, physical production and distribution, etc) necessitate a larger volume of content over which those costs can be amortized
- waterfall vs agile software development
	- a large release is an integration of multiple smaller releases
	- as the fixed costs of releasing versions decreases (e.g. with digital distribution over the internet), it becomes beneficial to break up releases into smaller chunks
- cities vs small towns
- US federal vs state government
- European Union
- government vs consumer, labor, etc unions
- tipping: paying e.g. a restaurant a single fee for both food and service vs paying each individually
- brands: "integrating" multiple products under a single label
	- Trader Joe's: integrating brand and store
- Photoshop has functionality for both photo editing and design/drawing/painting
- leadership {word?}: knowledge is more easily integrated by a single person than across people (given the standard integration vs outsourcing tradeoffs)
- holism vs reductionism

### Multiscalar systems
A way to integrate while remaining flexible.  Glue together low level functionality to create higher level functionality.  Give users access to all levels.  Common use cases will use higher levels, uncommon use cases will use lower levels (similar to entropy encoding and compression).  This is only feasible when both the high level and low level functionality can be supported in parallel.

Extensibility

Examples:
- git
- software GUI with scripting system
- smartphones: integrated hardware but extensible with add-ons (camera, microphone, etc)
