{Generalize into "cyclicality" {cycles}; not only the back-and-forth of a pendulum, but also the multiple levels of cycles of different frequencies.}

Sometimes biases are over-corrected.

When viewing this through the lens of "progressive refinement", the pendulum effect comes about simply because, after each "update" (increase in precision/decrease in uncertainty), there's a 50/50 chance of the distribution's mean being on either side of the "ideal" (assuming only imprecision, not inaccuracy), and over time it will switch back and forth between sides.
- Analogy of binary search: first figure out which half, then which quarter, etc.  The mean of the current section will switch between too high and too low at least once (except when the value lies at one of the ends).  See my google sheets visualization.

Examples:
- hype cycle: new technologies or other creations are over-hyped, then become unfashionable as they fail to meet unreasonable expectations, then are accepted as their true benefits are understood and applied
	- programming paradigms (OOP, FP)
	- AI
	- big data
	- genomics
- extreme versions of feminism, or any other reaction to the status quo
- too much reliance on market validation, having swung in the right direction, but too far, from theory and intuition {vague, speculative}
	- Same with cultural reaction to science?  People may overfit to bleeding edge science, giving too much weight to single studies.
- rationalism: completely ignoring intuition and using narrowly scoped rationality ([bounded rationality](Bounded%20rationality.md))
	- First you purely use intuition, then you learn about rationality and completely disregard intuition, and then you realize that intuition can have a logical basis and you learn to heed intuition within your rational framework. "The pitfall of the aspiring rationalist".
- watching a documentary and believing it's message; discover issues with the documentary's claims which casts doubt on the whole film; slowly figure out which of its arguments are flawed and which are valid
- not clean enough living environments -> too clean of living environments {maybe}

[justified means](Justified%20means.md): justified means is often used to popularize the bias (or new product), and people can take that extreme view literally, instead of as a corrective force ([anchoring](Justified%20means.md#anchoring))\
