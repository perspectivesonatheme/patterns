There is a complexity floor below which a theory will not have enough bits {degrees of freedom} to fit the data.  However, there is no ceiling—a theory with more bits than needed can still fit the data.  Among fitting theories, the more complex ones:
- require more computation to apply and manipulate
- obfuscate relationships and patterns with irrelevant information
- suggest a more precise interpretation than is warranted

Principle of parsimony

[entropy](Entropy.md): the number of theories (microstates) of a given complexity (macrostate) increases with the degree of complexity\
[overfitting](Overfitting.md): noise in the data can give the impression of complexity


{Unify the following?}

A sufficiently broad {adaptable} theory can appear to explain phenomena.

Prediction, falsifiability, constraint of expectations

Examples:
- string theory?
- God as an omnipotent being with unknowable rationale
- "There's no way the program should be doing that—must be a compiler bug."


In uncertain (esp. complex) situations, there's bound to be aspects which fit a simple and plausible theory.\
Given phenomena, the ability to cherry pick aspects which fit an alternative theory.

Examples:
- conspiracy theories
- astrology
