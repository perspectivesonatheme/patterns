Mathematical function of distance from setpoint to force towards / away from setpoint.

Negative feedback relative to a setpoint.

Generally, the further a system gets from equilibrium, the stronger the forces become to pull it back into equilibrium (regression). At the same time, the system can become more volatile and less predictable (dependent on the dynamics of the higher order system). A regain of equilibrium can happen through (spectrum between) sufficient pulling of the corrective forces, or by a disruption of the system's structure (revolution)—a new structure with a new equilibrium being built from the higher entropy level. Sometimes the setpoint will be pulled towards the current state in addition to the current state being pushed back towards the setpoint.

A good analogy is plate tectonics. If there's too much friction as two plates slide past one another, they bind up, moving the system away from equilibrium. The further from equilibrium the system gets, the more disruption there will be when the plates are freed (earthquake).

Equilibrium vs feedback loops: negative vs positive feedback

Stable vs unstable equilibria  
Attractors

Examples:
- healing of biological systems
- growing pains: negative reaction to a movement of an equilibrium's setpoint
- "honeymoon" phase: a pleasant phase before something settles into an equilibrium

Related: degrading gracefully
- when the force required to pull a parameter away from equilibrium increases as the distance from equilibrium increases {right?}
- it's important to not just consider how a design fits the problem, but also its failure modes; for example, instituting a dictatorship might be a good way to fix the current problems of a country, but it has historically turned out badly in the long run when someone abuses the power of the position (i.e. it's an unstable equilibrium)

[predictions](Predictions.md): it can be difficult to predict changes to the system as a whole when a parameter gets too far from equilibrium


### Desensitization
When stimulation diminishes the effect of subsequent stimuli.  Essentially, this is a movement of the setpoint in reaction to a stimulus.

Examples:
- swearing
- violence
- saying "thank you" all the time
	- although you can use an emphatic form of "thank you" more sparingly
- metaphor of a frog slowly being boiled
- becoming overweight: gain a little weight, after a while that becomes your norm; repeat


### Baseline
Baseline vs deviation  
Reference dependence

Norm, reference (point)  
Ground state vs excited  
Home base  
Habitual vs occasional behavior  
Lifestyle vs goal (e.g. dieting, exercise)  
Background vs signal

Regression to the mean

Similarity with nominal vs real
