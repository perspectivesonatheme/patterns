{Rename: inference}

The priming of expectations.

Evaluation of an uncertainty using indirect evidence\
Experiences create expectations (accommodation) which then influence the interpretation of future experiences (assimilation)\
Experience modifies our mental basis, which modifies our experience\
The feedback between perception and belief

Statistical inference: inferring properties of an underlying distribution through analysis of samples.  Specifically, Bayesian inference, which this pattern is an instance of.

{TODO: use of "basis" vs "schema"?}

Due to uncertainty, it's not always rational to update a belief {basis, schema} when presented with conflicting evidence.  If you have a successful belief (i.e. it has strong predictive ability) and one piece of evidence doesn't fit, you have to weigh the probability that the belief is wrong against the probability that the evidence is wrong (spurious or noisy data, misinterpretation of data, etc).  Compare this to someone without an existing belief (e.g. if they're young): since they have no belief for the evidence to contradict, they're free to accept it as is.  Comparatively, the person defending their belief may seem biased (and they may very well be, if they give more credence to their belief than it deserves).

- (When asked what he would have done had Sir Eddington's observations been inconsistent with his theory of general relativity) "Then I would have been sorry for the dear Lord; the theory is correct." (Einstein)
- "In 1781, Isaac Newton’s laws of motion and gravitation were used to predict the orbit of a newly discovered planet called Uranus. The prediction was wrong. But instead of accepting that Newton’s laws were thus falsified, the problem was solved simply by tinkering with the auxiliary assumptions, in this case by making the box a little bigger. John Adams and Urbain Le Verrier independently proposed that there was an as-yet-unobserved eighth planet in the solar system that was perturbing the orbit of Uranus. Neptune was duly discovered, in 1846, very close to the position predicted by Le Verrier." (https://aeon.co/essays/post-empirical-science-is-an-oxymoron-and-it-is-dangerous)

Dogma: something like an absolute prior\
Retrodiction: using present information to explain past events
- for example, if you were told something was cheap and you didn't like it, then were told it was actually expensive which made you like it more

Self-reinforcing preconceptions vs overfitting to a small number of samples
- a belief can bias the interpretation of evidence such that it reinforces the belief, regardless of whether the evidence supports it
	- confirmation bias, prejudice
	- "When the only tool you have is a hammer, all problems look like nails."
	- [feedback loops](Feedback%20loops.md)
- on the other end of the spectrum, giving too much weight to a small number of samples is [overfitting](Overfitting.md)
	- "You can't judge a book by its cover."
		- {However, this proverb is usually used to mean judging something by unrelated criteria (e.g. judging something's content based on how it looks).  I think it also implies judging something by a few samples of the whole (e.g. the title of a book or an excerpt on its cover), but perhaps the proverb isn't the most apt for this use.}
- the flip side of this is robustness vs adaptability

The tradeoff between learning from others and avoiding internalizing their biases
- [first-hand experience](First-hand%20experience.md) and [filtering](First-hand%20experience.md#filtering)
- [traction](Traction.md): this is two sides to the same coin; learning correct knowledge vs learning biased knowledge—you can't always know which you're learning, so increasing one is likely to increase the other

Science (through the lens of this pattern)
- since different people can have different priors, they can come to different conclusions given the same information; we need some way of reconciling these differences
- if you remove the uncertainty in the signal, it leaves no room for interpretation

Ben Franklin effect: actions can feed back into beliefs

Buddhism: beginner's mind

Examples:
- liking something more when you know it's expensive
	- Because your experience of something can change based on context, a single experience is only a sample of the distribution of enjoyment across all contexts.  If an experience is middling, that sample is more likely to be below the mean if it was expensive, and above the mean if it was cheap (all else being equal, and assuming a real correlation between price and quality/enjoyment).
- basing the judgment of an argument on its source rather than its premises and logic
	- if you can't fully evaluate an argument on its own merit (because of complexity or lack of knowledge in the subject), you're left with evaluating it based on indirect qualities like source, how confidently the argument is asserted, etc
- college and GPA as a priming for abilities, work ethic, etc
- relation to the placebo/nocebo effect (just the psychological priming, not the physiological response)
- after training a model/theory using a set of examples, there can be uncertainty in how and whether other examples fit the model; if an example doesn't fit, it might be that the model needs to be modified to fit the example, or that the interpretation of the example needs to be modified to fit the model
	- e.g. my pictographic abstraction/integration model
	- similarly, there's the discovery aspect of abstraction, where a basis/abstraction suggests a particular factorization
		- e.g. a programming language (its basis being its constituent constructs) suggests a particular program structure
- the halo effect
- basing an opinion on other people's opinions
- ratings sites like rotten tomatoes and their effect on people's evaluations
- whether or not to amend the constitution
	- which is wrong: the constitution, our interpretation of the constitution, or our current belief that is incompatible with the constitution?
- stereotypes
- judging a book by its cover
- language influences and is influenced by the interpretation of experience
- knowledge is the basis with which a stimulus (data) is transformed into a perception (information, signal)
- brands: opinion of a brand influences and is influenced by people's evaluation of a product
