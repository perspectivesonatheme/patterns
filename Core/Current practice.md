Using absolute terms to express relative change.

Relative correction vs fixed ideal

A note about terminology - “absolute” has two meanings that are relevant to this pattern: “fixed/independent location” and “extreme of spectrum”.  This note will use "absolute" or "extreme" in the latter sense, and "fixed" in the former sense.

Language is sometimes simplified into absolute terms when expressing the direction of an ideal from the status quo.  This may sometimes be interpreted literally to mean that the absolute is being advocated.

Reactionary movements: others may advocate the opposite extreme as a reaction to a perceived absolute.

Relative terms say nothing about where the ideal lies, whereas fixed terms say nothing about the direction in which the status quo lies relative to the ideal.

Examples:
- "You can do anything you set your mind to." Absolutely? No. But perhaps relative to most people's self-assessment of their potential.
- identifying as "open-minded", meaning "more open-minded relative to some baseline" as compared to "will entertain anything, no matter how crazy"
- Bernie Sanders calling himself a socialist instead of just "more towards the socialist end of the spectrum than the US currently is"
- "feminism" as a relative term meaning "towards gender equality", as compared to a fixed term like "equigenderism"
	- similarly, "the future is female"
- "black lives matter" vs "all lives matter"
	- "all lives matter" is a fixed goal; "black lives matter" is a correction
- preferring encountering a bear in the woods than a man

Also, interpreting absolute language as relative:
- Peter Thiel: "I think a lot of the voters who vote for Trump take Trump seriously, but not literally."
