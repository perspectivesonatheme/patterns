The imitation of behavior using insufficient fidelity to reproduce the desired effect.

Recreating a correlation without the necessary causation.\
The misattribution of effects.

The lack of understanding of the rationale behind a behavior, resulting in failed reproduction.

Doing things in a way that looks to be correct but in fact differs from the actual way, while still expecting to achieve the desired result.

Examples:
- teaching a subject in school because that's what's supposed to be taught, instead of understanding why that subject is important to learn
- agile software development: enacting only convenient processes while skipping necessary ones
- giving presents: the reason why we give presents vs giving presents because that's what you're supposed to do
- similar: rat race
- when intramural sports teams use the strategies of the pros, even though the dynamics of the game at the lower skill level are significantly different and teams would be better served by a strategy specialized to their level
	- taking advantage of this bias: the high school football team that never punts
	- the flip side: copying the strategies of the pros is easier; doesn't require deep knowledge of the game, which is likely overkill at the intramural level
- reasoning by analogy vs reasoning from first principles
	- reasoning by analogy can be more efficient, but is susceptible to the drawbacks of dead reckoning (see below)
- saying "an historic" even when pronouncing the 'h'
- spelling out numbers less than 10, otherwise using numerals {?}

Cargo cult repeated on top of cargo cult is like dead reckoning (see [history](Dynamic%20analysis.md#history)).  Just like any lossy transformation, errors accumulate with repeated application.  Theory can act like a lighthouse, grounding practice.
- traditions get passed down without, necessarily, their rationale, which may be impractical to deduce or difficult to articulate, or may have simply been forgotten
- similarity with (opposite of) idempotence?

Also: "successful cargo cult" {rename}: when an incidental {apparent, imaginary, arbitrary} reason is used to justify a beneficial behavior.  Note that this focuses on the cargo cult aspectâ€”these things aren't necessarily misjustified.
- praying may be good for a person (e.g. being thankful, as a form of meditation, a way to show others you care, etc), but these reasons are distinct from the "appealing to a higher power" reason
	- prayer is a sufficient condition for the benefits, not a necessary one
- religion, traditions in general
	- kosher, not eating pork, etc
	- lent - fasting
- [right for the wrong reasons](Justified%20beliefs.md)
- regular cargo cult is a misattribution of effect; this is a misjustification of behavior

Relationship to heuristics, aesthetics?

[proxies](Proxies.md)\
[conflation](Conflation.md): treating both the actual and cargo cult behavior as if they should have the same results\
[ignorance](Ignorance.md)\
[overfitting](Overfitting.md): related to underfitting?\
[isomorphism](Isomorphism.md): to the cargo cult follower, their behavior is isomorphic to the behavior they're imitating; to the "actual practitioner" however, the cargo cult behavior is not isomorphic to their own\
[empirical vs theoretical](Empirical%20vs%20theoretical.md): cargo cult is similar to not having the theory behind your actions\
[evolution vs design](Evolution%20vs%20design.md)\
[chesterton's fence](Chesterton's%20fence.md): both involve a lack of understanding of the original rationale
