When some force acts to limit the effects of extreme, transient forces.

Analogies: moving a massive object (inertia), ballast

Examples:
- culture as a lpf for individual beliefs
- ethics
- scientific consensus for individual experiments
- an individual's lower brain for their higher brain
	- fake it till you make it / fake it till you become it (Amy Cuddy)
	- Takes a while for some of your lower level brain processes to line up with your higher level ones. Sort of like a smoothing algorithm for the whims of your higher brain. So, need to keep steady pressure against the lower level processes (assuming the higher level ones are correct), and eventually they will fall in line. No doubt not all lower level processes can be controlled like this.
	- Spectrum between addiction-prone, impulsive, jump in with both feet, early bird gets the worm, go-getter (weak lpf); and analysis paralysis, cautious, procrastinator, deliberate, reasoned, patient, delayed gratification (strong lpf). ([traction](Traction.md))
- democracy/majoritarianism
- Bayesian prior

[equilibrium](Equilibrium.md): two different views on the same thing; lpf emphasizes slow change, equilibrium emphasizes a return to a set-point\
[priming](Priming.md), [baseline](Equilibrium.md#baseline), [desensitization](Equilibrium.md#desensitization): "rubber band effect" between the baseline and the deviation\
[justified means](Justified%20means.md) and [ignorance](Ignorance.md): lpf controlling for the risk of extreme signals being wrong
