Analyzing the rate of change of a system instead of just its static state.  Not just first-order derivative but higher order as well.

Judging something by its purpose (incentive structure, philosophy, motives) vs its current state.  Something's purpose is an indicator of how it will evolve.  (Sometimes the current state is all that matters.)

Examples:
- in software development, using a single object for two distinct concepts because in their current state, they are similar enough to be represented with the same code (can lead to blob antipattern); distinction to be made between using a single object, but it being easy to separate later (which is fine), vs making the conflation a fundamental assumption that other decisions are based upon (which is problematic) ([conflation](Conflation.md))
- progress: we'll never reach a point where we call technology good enough, so why bother? you can take a dynamic view and say that it's not about the current state, but that we're moving forward, with the debate being about what the ideal rate of progress should be
	- instead of "the level of progress will never be good enough", this: "the rate of progress is good enough"
	- "Happiness is not an objective.  It is the movement of life itself, a process, and an activity." (Rules For a Knight)
	- Science as a way to discover an ultimate theory of everything vs science as an infinite process
- journey vs destination: the dynamic present vs future end-goal
	- goals in general: e.g. lifestyle change vs diet
- rational actor model {verify, improve}: its use in some situations depends on the value being optimized: short term (marginal) utility, or utility at some later date?  In other words, at present, is the 1st order derivative being optimized, or the 2nd, 3rd, etc?  Or more precisely, what is the utility function for all the orders put together (e.g. U = .2*first + .4*second + .6*third; need to take into account increasing uncertainty for higher orders)?
	- for example, if someone increases their marginal utility by cheating someone else, it may be irrational if future costs are factored in (social consequences, unlikely to be trusted in the future, etc)

- change in poverty rate over time vs point-in-time difference between poor and wealthy

### History
Knowing something's history can give you a better sense of its purpose than just looking at the current state.  This is one benefit of learning history in general.

Examples:
- software version control
- word etymology
- intention of the founders when interpreting the constitution
- as compared to dead reckoning: using only your previous position to determine current position; errors accumulate without a fixed reference point
	- restarting a computer as a means to revert to a fixed reference point
