A la carte vs package  
Pay per ____ vs subscription

With packages, some things "come along for the ride" that would otherwise not be valuable enough to get a la carte.

The tradeoffs involved are given by [abstraction-integration](Abstraction-integration.md).

Examples:
- vudu vs netflix
- vacation time when paid hourly vs salaried
- wage vs salary
- cable tv packages
- ideologies: picking and choosing individual ideas from multiple sources vs subscribing to ideologies wholesale
	- religions
	- political parties
	- books or other collections of ideas
	- musical genres or other categories
	- people: assigning people labels/categorizing them (See NGT's big think video about atheism)
- individual consumer, labor, etc unions vs government
- library vs framework
- oled vs lcd: with lcd, there's no attention paid to e.g. UI luminance because you're already "on the hook" for the full power expenditure, whereas oled uses less power the darker the image shown—with oled, you pay for luminance a la carte
- highway tolls
- paying out of pocket vs insurance premiums
- games: micro-transactions
- loyalty programs
	- discounted marginal costs in exchange for fixed payments, signing up for a credit card, etc
