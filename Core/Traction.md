{Rename?: This appears as minimizing misfits in the work of C. Alexander: http://wiki.c2.com/?NotesOnTheSynthesisOfForm}

Balancing competing, correlated concerns to maximize overall utility.

Imprecision in the selection {?} function {criteria} results in an optimum containing both good and bad elements.

Self-organized criticality: a property of dynamical systems that have a critical point as an attractor. (Wikipedia)

Maximizing benefit while maintaining an acceptable level of cost.  Often, increasing benefits also increases costs.  You want to optimize for net benefit.  Often involves balancing competing variables, with the sweet spot somewhere in the middle of the two extremes.

{Improve, add picture}  
Think of as a graph of number of attempts vs value of outcome and difficulty (using a 2d graph these can be combined, with increasing value up to a point, then zero value after, which represents failure {the value curve doesn't have to be y=x followed by y=0, but it's a good simplification; it could be any function, e.g. maybe it just switches to y=-x instead of y=0}). The graph of attempts would form a distribution (since it's impossible to perfectly evaluate task difficulty, there will be some imprecision). You want to position the distribution so that, when multiplied by the value function, you maximize its integral.  It's like launching a car from a standstill: you try to give the most throttle while maintaining grip to achieve the best acceleration (hence "traction").

If you're not failing at all, it's possible the curve is too far to the leftâ€”maybe you're not taking enough risks.  However, you also want to make the distribution as skinny as possible, so you can move it as far to the right as possible without failing too much.

The differentiating factor here as compared to the other criticality patterns is imprecision in the selection function, and optimality of the critical point. Otherwise it's just [criticality](Criticality.md): switching between two classes of behavior.

"Double-edged sword"  
"Two sides of the same coin"

Examples:
- trying something new vs continuing to do what has been proven to work; pushing the boundary ([practice vs performance](Investment.md#practice-vs-performance))
- if you never fail, you're not challenging yourself enough (depending on how severe the costs of failing are)
- if you never overthink anything, you're probably not thinking about things enough (same with underthinking)
- biological evolution: balance between more mutations (more chance for innovation and more risk) and fewer mutations (less innovation, less risk)
- balance "aggressiveness" of humans' pattern recognition ability between weak recognition and [overfitting](Overfitting.md) (recognizing patterns that don't exist)
- balance creativity and other positive mental qualities with schizophrenia and other psychopathologies
- balance between weak and overly aggressive immune system (fight off pathogens but limit allergies)
	- [false positives and false negatives](Testing.md#false-positives-and-false-negatives)
- balance between questioning authority and believing extreme conspiracy theories
- balance cynicality and gullibility
- technological evolution: faster evolution means more likely to make mistakes or not test as much as should
- politics: more churn of politicians = less experience but more new ideas (more general than just politics)
- advocating ideas: the more ideas you advocate (and the earlier in the idea's development you advocate them), the more risk you'll be wrong and possibly lead people astray; balanced with advocating less and teaching less
- modern portfolio theory: a theory of finance that attempts to maximize portfolio expected return for a given amount of portfolio risk (Wikipedia)
- amount of inequality vs economic growth
- willpower: delayed gratification/self-control vs uncertainty that the investment will pay off
	- "A failure of self-control ... may not be a failure so much as a reasoned response to the uncertainty of time" (http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/youre-so-self-controlling.html?_r=1&pagewanted=all)
- "Research links creativity with inability to filter irrelevant sensory information." (http://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2015/03/creative-genius-driven-by-distraction.html)
- corrections: maximizing deterrence while minimizing recidivism and harm to the punished
- balancing mammograms (and other diagnostics) causing cancer and detecting existing cancer
- "It's better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all."
	- not loving at all is like pushing the curve so far to the left that there's no chance of heartbreak
- Equilibrium (the movie): getting rid of all of the bad parts of human nature at the expense of all the good parts
- race cars push the limit of performance, risking mechanical failures, safety, etc
